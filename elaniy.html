<h1>Hey Elaniy,</h1>

<p>
    I know you as a friend, but you're so much more than that. You’ve always stood by my side, supporting me no matter what, believing in me even when I struggled to believe in myself. I can’t even begin to explain how grateful I am for everything you’ve done for me. Every small act of kindness, every moment of support—it all meant more than you probably realize. That’s why I made <strong>Hydration</strong>. It wasn’t just a project; it was my way of giving back, of showing you even a fraction of the appreciation you deserve.
</p>

<p>
    I’ve wanted to do more for you, but for the longest time, I felt like I couldn’t. Until I realized that because of you, I was already pushing myself further than I ever thought possible. Now, I’m working on other projects, chasing dreams I never thought I could reach—and that’s all because of you. You may not even realize how much you’ve changed me, but you did. I rarely show it, and maybe I don’t say it enough, but I appreciate you more than I can ever put into words.
</p>

<h2>But there’s also something I need to say.</h2>

<p><strong>I’m sorry.</strong></p>

<p>
    For the past six months—probably even longer—I haven’t treated you the way you deserved. The way I acted, the way I constantly brought my problems to you, knowing that you were already struggling yourself… it wasn’t fair to you. And looking back, I don’t even know what I was thinking. I’m also sorry for the things I sent you—I should have worded them better, or maybe I shouldn’t have sent them at all. I understand if you still feel like blocking me for two months, or even forever. I really do. Because I haven’t been good for you, and I can’t blame you if you don’t want me in your life anymore.
</p>

<p>
    Still, I just want you to know—truly, from the bottom of my heart—I am sorry.
</p>

<p>
    And thank you. For everything.
</p>
